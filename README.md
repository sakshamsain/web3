# Decentralized E-Commerce using ETHEReact!

# Description
ETHEReact is a full-stack DApp, showcasing e-commerce capabilities without relying on any traditional database for the backend. Instead, it utilizes the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) as its backbone. While not a product in itself, it serves as an idea for aspiring blockchain enthusiasts to explore the full potential of decentralized applications, from end to end.

    This app utilizes Truffle-powered testrpc (also known as ganache) for local development.
    Web3 serves as the bridge between Ethereum and ReactJS
